Before creating any events you need to start the threads (by pressing the start button). There will be random events everytime you start the application but the user can trigger "manual events" by pressing the other 3 buttons ("grandma", "call 991", "dog"). At the end of the application the exit codes of the threads will be printed in the textbox.
